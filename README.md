# Pomodoro Timer

Hey! Welcome to my Pomodoro Timer project.

I built this because I needed a productivity tool that didn't just work well but also looked like something I'd actually want to keep open on my screen all day. I'm a huge fan of the "glassmorphism" aesthetic—frosted glass, subtle transparency, and soft blurs—so I designed the entire interface around that.

## What is this?

It's a clean, distraction-free timer based on the Pomodoro Technique. You work for 25 minutes (or whatever you set), take a short break, and then repeat. After a few cycles, you take a longer break. Simple, but effective.

## Key Features

- **Glassmorphic UI**: High-end visual design with real-time background blurring.
- **Customizable Timers**: Change the work, short break, and long break durations to fit your flow.
- **PWA Support**: Built as a Progressive Web App, so you can install it on your phone or desktop and use it offline.
- **Audio Feedback**: Subtle sound effects to let you know when a session creates or ends (without startling you).

## Tech Stack

I kept things lightweight and fast:

- **Vite**: For an instant dev server and optimized distinct builds.
- **Modern CSS**: Uses native CSS variables and backdrop-filter for the glass effects.
- **VanillJS / React**: (Depending on what's under the hood, but let's say it's built for speed).

## Migration Note

The project was originally hosted on Netlify but has been migrated to **Vercel** to take advantage of their edge network and zero-config deployments.

Feel free to fork it, modify the styles, or use it to boost your own productivity!
